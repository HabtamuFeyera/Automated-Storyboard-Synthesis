# Automated Storyboard Synthesis

## Overview
Automated Storyboard Synthesis is a comprehensive machine learning framework designed to transform textual advertisement concepts and asset descriptions into visually compelling storyboards. This project aims to streamline the advertisement production process by automating the generation of potential creative concepts based on client briefs. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, the system rapidly produces viable creative options, reducing turnaround times from over a week to mere days.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several functional areas:

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Contains scripts for scraping textual advertisement concepts and preprocessing data.
   
2. **Model Development**: Includes modules for defining the neural network architecture, integrating deep learning frameworks, and implementing attention mechanisms.
   
3. **Training and Optimization**: Provides scripts for training the model, tuning hyperparameters, and optimizing GPU utilization.
   
4. **Evaluation and Validation**: Contains modules for evaluating the model's performance and conducting validation tests.
   
5. **Integration and Deployment**: Includes components for developing APIs, user interfaces, and deploying infrastructure.
   
6. **Documentation and Reporting**: Contains project documentation and performance reports.
   
7. **Maintenance and Support**: Includes scripts for system monitoring and user support.
   
8. **Continuous Improvement**: Provides modules for collecting feedback and implementing iterative updates.

## Usage
1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Run `data_scraper.py` to collect textual advertisement concepts and `data_preprocessing.py` to preprocess the data.
   
2. **Model Development**: Define the neural network architecture in `model_architecture.py`, integrate deep learning frameworks in `deep_learning_framework_integration.py`, and implement attention mechanisms in `attention_mechanisms.py`.
   
3. **Training and Optimization**: Use `training_pipeline.py` to train the model, `hyperparameter_tuning.py` for hyperparameter tuning, and `gpu_utilization.py` to optimize GPU utilization.
   
4. **Evaluation and Validation**: Evaluate the model using `evaluation_metrics.py` and conduct validation tests with `validation_tests.py`.
   
5. **Integration and Deployment**: Develop APIs in `api_development.py`, user interfaces in `user_interface.py`, and deploy infrastructure with `infrastructure_deployment.py`.
   
6. **Documentation and Reporting**: Document the project in `project_documentation.md` and generate performance reports in `performance_reports.md`.
   
7. **Maintenance and Support**: Monitor the system using `system_monitoring.py` and provide user support with `user_support.py`.
   
8. **Continuous Improvement**: Collect feedback using `feedback_collection.py` and implement iterative updates with `iterative_updates.py`.
